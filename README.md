This is my solution of the task in which I was given a file (zadanie-dane.txt) with a bunch of pairs: 

-number of package
-laptops inside

I was supposed to write a program in Java that will optimize their transportation by dividing them into sets of max 250 pieces for a single course. 

The result should be a list of numbers of packages that will be packed to a car in each course.
